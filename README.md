# File Watcher

A basic file watcher written in Go!

## About

This tool was originally created for my build tool `blmake`, to watch for when specifically C/C++ files change as a way to implement incremental recompilation.

However, I ended up liking the project more than I thought I would, so I decided to make a standalone version that works on all file types and traverses recursively.

## Usage
